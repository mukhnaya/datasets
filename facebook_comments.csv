"President William Ruto and I have today witnessed the signing of an agreement between our respective political parties. The ODM Party of Kenya and The UDA Party of Kenya have signed a roadmap MOU on how to resolve the social, economic, and political challenges facing Kenya. We have further acknowledged the need to set up a broad platform for collaboration and co-operation between all political forces and other stakeholders in Kenya in order to address these  long-standing challenges that threaten our nationhood."

Good job Baba....you can't remain the opposition leader forever.
It's good so that our people can a get a punishment they deserve. Support him even in 2027 elections baba.
It's only a mad person and a person with IQ less than 0.05 who can support Raila going forward.
"I wonder if baba ignore the work of opposition.,"
Good move indeed.God bless
"Kenyans'are never divided. We have always co-existed very well. So what you've done is not new to us, you always do the same but things never get any better. This time round we are alert and our votes are intact with us waiting to send you home in 2027."
Peace is all what we want
"Let's move forward, others can as well take up the opposition mantle, why always Raila,"
He's called Raila broad best Odinga government

That's why this old man has been criticizing matiangi's campaigns

Betrayal in the state house serving personal interest
Die like chebukati we forget you.. political conman! You can't live to see the next election

The same way you were used by the other president is still the same way you will be used here

You are just but a betrayer. You just killed the loyalty I had for you. Have nothing else but to wish you Total failure in whatever you do

It's in the best interest of Kenya. We want development right away not from 2027.
I think it's the benefit of both of you not kenyans as you're already suggesting...it's good ODM is the party to shoulder on when things don't go your way.
We are now waiting for the handshake between kalonzo and raila

"Stop marinating corruption, we just need good healthcare tukiwa na afya we will deal with agriculture and the rest"
Those who voted to send you to bondo are now crying everywhere.
Problem with Kenya is politicking throughout making it difficult for leadership to work. That's why we have 5 years to scrutinize and re-elect.
Sawa conman
And Raila will be in power 2027 after Matiang'i has won the election
"We all know your nature after loosing the presidency you proceed to demonstration then finally handshake ,, yours is only Nusu mkate ,,nyota yako ilizimwa 1997 wakati wa Moi"

Have confirmed you are a conman as miguna miguna said
I trusted this politician called Raila back in 2022 I never slept so that I can vote for him very early in the morning. But he is a scavenger if he doesn't get the seat he joins forces with others to finish us. I thought he has kenyans best interest I heart
None of our business lakini tunajua ww ukishimba husumbui
The most selfish man
"Anyway,,,
we just have to follow the rules not unless!"
N kwl the curse from your father is still following I thought it was a propaganda but I have realized it's a true story
"When Raila is happy , everybody is happy including Gachagua"
You have done a great thing Baba
It's not easy to believe that this agreement can yield anything.
I personally have so many questions.
What if baba sees that age has cut ties with him in the political space? … See more
We love you baba kwa kushikilia our president
Raila Odinga is a political conman
You betrayed us .whoever thinks your're a hero no you lost what u call freedom sijui democracy
"Congratulations
and thank you baba for this bold decision to work with government,working for the people of Kenya."
My country Kenya is the headquarters of politics
A sick conman indeed
Hii akili ungetumia uko AU but i love it you are the most trusted politician in Kenya's history..
Mkora wewe.
6k itaingia ama?
I'm in full support baba. Mtu wao mtu wetu. Let's be fools together.
"Kenyans should send you packing In 2027,ur the problem facing kenya today"
I think you're going to save us instead you want to sacrifice us again #BABA
Shame on you!
"Ile combination mmeunda ni deadly
Kuna mjinga Ako na hope na nyinyi mahali"
You took a wise decision Baba
"I said,n will repeat,Raila is an opportunist."
You have decided to stay with our oppressor
If all the efforts are to make Kenya great again I pray for them to succeed
A failure regime that makes nonsense handshakes to loot for their own interest in Kenya. Let us wait and watch what will happen in your collaboration with kasongo
Mit mayatayiiii.....

"Always shaking hands, hope it benefits the Gen Z na Wanainchi wa Kenya uwote not just the gas business peke"
The indomitable politician in Kenyan politics.
Just like in the bible Esau sold his birthright to his brother Jacob because of GREEDNESS
You have sold us young people and all Kenyans for a small coins from kasongo
"If you people can't make Baba the President ,then let Baba play his politics in peace ..He is no ones saviour nor an NGO to run to during crisis ,he is a father ,a grandfather and a husband ... Congratulations Jakom may you live long"
What a wise Move Baba
This gentleman has lost the meaning of freedom fighter he now fights for his stomach
Baba the forth arm of the government.
You are not for us but yourself and your friends
Shameless greedy old man!
"Failure and wicked guy in thy history of Kenya , hell"
We Kenyans no longer need you...let's fight for ourselves.fight for your stomach.......
The MOU. In simple terms means Kenya got NO opposition party that will be helding accountable the government of the day.
So AUC was a ploy to shift our focus while the goose was being cooked. Enyewe politicians are cunning.
Don't forget Abt 2007 history will repeat itself...sungoi and Bondo is unstoppable
"This is what Gachagwa demanded ""MOU"" and you ousted him. Indeed, someone's ignorance is another's benefit."
The stone that the builders rejected...
You have indeed destroyed your legacy...we would have celebrated you as a legend if you had chose to retire from politics... thanks for showing Kenya that politicians are hungry motherfuckers.....
"There has never been a political prostitute in the history of Kenya comparable to this man Raila Odinga. I’m sorry if I’m wrong but in two and a half years when he looses, again he will come up with yet another reason to ally himself with someone else.… See more"
You are always denying a strong opposition for Kenyans when they need it most to check the government. You don't learn from your past mistake that cost you the state house.
"Handshake courtesy of Gen z blood..what a useless end for a man who pretended to be working for a common man, now all your friends will be employed..sad"
Chwadwa Aluf Auchiel cha baba..
Mimi hapana Pinga Tinga.
"Your Marriage will be only for 2 years, after 2027 we will have a new president who will listen to Kenyans and make our economy more sustainable to every Kenyan"
Trouble maker in Kenyan politics
And now the opposition is officially in bed with the GVT
"This is a very bold move, and it will benefit you most. We also will benefit, feliyaaaas coming together, home is inevitable."
"Ndio baba for those complaining let them go plant there fathers to go and fight for Kenyans akia pingo,baba is always right no more maandamano on the streets"
Conman and broker
Baba in 2027 vie for president then 2032 Kasongo akujie second term if they trust in your agreement!!
KENYA FOR JESUS CHRIST.
Shame on you.These handshakes are too much and they are not helping Kenyans.
Denzel Omondi had to die for you and your friends to negotiate for positions in government.
Raila Odinga has more say in government than Mr yes sir Kenyans tumeisha sasa
Hauko sure umetuuza.
Good...you against kenyans
"It's OK but your decision is far from bettering kenya
Kenyans mungu mbele siku zote"
"R and R are
of a feather"
"Viva Baba u don't owe any one an explanation they sent u to bondo, they didn't vote for u either"
Kenya will grow when self-political brokers like you will exit the stage.
We will defeat all of you at the same time.
What does this handshake help Kenya .... Since
"Raila you are always number two in every thing you do,,, can you tell Kenyans briefly Why,,"
Jaluo must calculate
Mt.Kenya leaders are thrown away indirectly
Well Well Well done
Killer of GenZ .. Eat him when u can. Kenya future for Kenyans..eat carcass whereas at it
Raila is a consumer
Wambata yu
Ukavalûka ûvingilite na ukiliita ta ing'oi
Ensure next month our 6k is implemented and Kenyans will forgive you.
Raila Odinga kula as you retire... You have betrayed Kalonzo after supporting you three times
The lord of poverty and conmanship and the the high priest of corruption ........ choices have consequences and I hope Kenyans wake up and vote wisely next election otherwise wait and see what this lethal combination can do to this country
"The doyen,""Jakom"" the real leader"
"""Betrayal in the City"", is not a setbook but a reality"
I really miss Gen. Miguna
"Enjoy power, you deserve playing second fiddle!"
I regret voting you twice Mr Conman
The most self centred political conman of our time
"What do people want Raila Odinga do for them. They will never see sense in whatsoever Raila does, what an old man can see while sitting many cannot see untill they feel and enjoy the fruits. Those who criticize Raila ask yourself what have you added to make Kenya grow?"
African presidents are wise rejecting you was the biggest thing ever
Election is not necessarily in Kenya . This is Nonsense
Kwendeni nyote wawili
Miguna miguna once talked about a conman ....
"We support the move to work with the government of the day for the betterment of our people. .Forever in our lives, you remain to be our political darling."
the odm if 2007 finaly gets it's justice
We are the official opposition now
"Congratulations baba
Mt Kenya we are so happy"
The end of Agwambo's political career. That's a very low end. What a shame
"Ati you ""witnessed"" by the way Raila confirmed yesterday that billions were used to fund his AUC bid so the MP for Juja told Kenyans plain thruth."
And you think it's going to be easy for you both. even your strong holds are tired. You will be surprised
Old confused conman without wisdom. Useless Man
Raila great handshake Man
"You are just seeking positions for yourselves. It's nothing about Kenya. Stop fooling the country, we have known you for over 35 years and this what you do best. Why lie when you can say the truth?"
Too baad.Your Legacy had just ended like that.You have let Kenyans down.
"On that you are alone,do whatever you gonna too to satisfie you and your begwik, majority are tired of you."

That's his habit from the time of the late Kibaki
Your ideas are as tired as yourself. Go to rest Babu
God bless Kenya
"Always right. they elected him , ""wasaidie kupeda"""
For selfish interests I guess
Broad based government
The lord of Poverty has crossed to the line of the oppressor to help the oppressor oppress the oppressed
That's why I now hate politics and I have got no time for it
The leadership we want
It is now the time for you to step down and stop addressing on behalf of luos now give the people of nyanza humble Time for them to make their decisions
Ndio BABA
Conmen regrouping
"Baba now start your campaigning with action, we kenyan we need action not words,"
"That is bad decision you have made, you will retire soon from politics, for now kuleni pesa tu!"
So technically no government can run without the input of Raila Odinga.
Looking for ward for the next government
Congratulations
"This is only for your own benefit and those around you, the political hawks in your party, nothing for the greater good. Looting of public resources will continue with impunity"
GOAT of Kenyan politics
"There is no need of voting in this country,Kama hii ndiyo Ujinga, you're benefiting while your voters are suffering..? Only some few kalenjins will praise you for this nonsense."

Lord of poverty joins the highest priest of corruption...Kenya is indeed doomed
"Thank you God for bringing them together, so that in 2027 we can end our problems for once and all."
So sad that you had to end up this way Mzee!
"This is very dangerous because in 1990 there was a guy called Povandolakoviscov Kityionshikov. Why did you skip the name, now I'm not going to finish the story."
"Seems like we've been forcing you to become our president, mafiii"
"Which challenges yet you guys are the ones finishing this country milking it right, left , n centre the problem for this country is people like you who don't think about others peoples lives matter but yourself"
"The only thing I expect is development in Western and Nyanza regions, Health, Roads education and Agriculture."
If you have ever supported Raila you are stupid
You owe nobody an apology. Keep doing this till Kenyans learn to Vote with their brains. Congratulations for this smart move.
"It's hard to liberate a country that is full of desperate, poor, and idle citizens. They get excited over small things and forget their suffering."

He thinks he is so entitled to get anything he wants! Why was I wrong about this man!
RAILA you knows how to play with pples minds but it's okay with ur ODM.
Baba keep confusing them until Kenyans see sense in voting right......can't keep going the opposite direction only to appear to know the right direction after elections......keep working with the people they 'Choose' until they choose you.

Baba hasn't been serious about liberation of this country.
You have lost 70% the support you have enjoyed for many years. No comeback you can make now

We don't need him anywhere we shall vote you out
What I am in love with Raila Odinga is that he will no longer be our president but he will be part of all the coming government if death can't take this machine man. Bravo for being here in Kenya.
The fall of Baba was a process in his own making!This is your Waterloo!Fare thee well....
"Ati you were consulting widely
so this is what kenyans told you to do."
No need of voting anymore in Kenya
